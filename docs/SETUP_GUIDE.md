## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

1. **Port Conflict**
   - If port 8000 is already in use, modify the `API_PORT` value in the `.env` file
   - Remember to update the frontend API client to point to the new port

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify SQL Server is running
   - Check that the connection details are correct
   - Ensure the user has appropriate permissions on the database
   - Make sure SQL Server authentication is enabled if using SQL authentication

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   - If you encounter module import errors, run:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For the portable environment, try:
     ```
     .\scripts\portable_env\setup.ps1
     ```

4. **File Permission Issues**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions to the `Email_Archive` directory
   - Check permissions on template files

### Frontend Issues

1. **Node.js Version**
   - Ensure you have Node.js 14.x or higher installed
   - Check with: `node --version`

2. **Port Conflict**
   - If port 5173 is already in use, Vite will automatically try the next available port
   - Look for the URL in the terminal output when starting the production server

3. **Backend Connection Issues**
   - Check if the backend server is running
   - Verify the API_BASE_URL in apiClient.js matches your backend URL
   - Check browser console for CORS errors (ensure backend has proper CORS settings)

4. **Build Errors**
   - Run `npm run build` to see detailed error messages
   - Check for any dependencies that need updating: `npm update`

5. **White Screen/Blank Page**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Try clearing your browser cache

### SMTP Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify the app password was entered correctly (no spaces)
   - Ensure you're using the correct email address
   - Check that 2FA is enabled on your account if using Gmail

2. **Connection Timeout**
   - Check your firewall or antivirus settings
   - Ensure port 587 is open for outgoing connections

### Google Drive Issues

1. **OAuth Setup Issues**
   - If "Desktop application" option is not available, try selecting "Other" or "Web application"
   - For "This app isn't verified" warning, click "Advanced" and then "Go to [Your App Name] (unsafe)"
   - For access denied errors, verify you added yourself as a test user

2. **Token Issues**
   - If you see token.pickle related errors, delete the file and run setup again:
     ```
     del credentials\token.pickle
     python credentials\setup_gdrive_oauth.py
     ```

3. **Upload Issues**
   - If files aren't appearing in Drive, verify the folder ID in your .env file
   - Check application logs for API errors
   - Ensure your Drive storage quota isn't full
